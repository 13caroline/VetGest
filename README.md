Within the curricular units of **Application Architectures** and **Interactive Systems**, the development of a platform was proposed, in order to guarantee its availability and performance, strengthening the application structures, and improving its usability, in an attempt to make it more easy to use and learn.
    
For this purpose, a platform was developed that allows the interaction of three entities (clients, veterinary clinic, veterinarian) aiming to make all this interaction simpler and adjusted to the technological trend of today.

## Tools
